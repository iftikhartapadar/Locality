Project Name: LOCALITY
Project Authors: Liana Adaza, Harisen Luby, Clarissa Alfonso, Angel Cruz-Salvador, Iftikhar Tapadar

PROBLEM STATEMENT :

General: Build inclusion and facilitate personal and community growth  

Refined: Teenagers & young adults need an easier way to find and create communities in order to foster a sense of belongingness and develop social awareness.   

 

SUMMARY PITCH :

Have you ever found yourself feeling stuck with nowhere to go? Tired of going to the same places and meeting the same people? Did you just move into a new city and have no idea what there is to do? Traditional social media platforms can only take you so far when your feed is full of people you already know; relying on a ‚Äúwho-knows-who" method of discovery makes finding new activities to do in your area difficult. 

LOCALITY is the solution to this problem.  LOCALITY is a website that serves as a centralized space for discovering local events.  Users can post event details to their community as well as promote them through convenient sharing methods with partner platforms. The site also encourages its users to go outside of their comfort zone through a random event generator and intentional recommendations. LOCALITY also makes 

the dive into other cultures less intimidating by providing background information about significant upcoming events. With people looking for more genuine ways to become an active member of their community, LOCALITY aims to aid discoverability and allow people to foster a sense of belongingness within their community. 

From Dia De Los Muertos to carnivals or from Lunar New Year to block parties, LOCALITY is designed to not only to celebrate yourself, but to celebrate others! Rediscover the magic of your local community, or if you are new to the area, find your home away from home. üòä

USER STORIES 

Devin is a new grad who has moved to a new neighborhood and is unfamiliar with its surrounding community. He seeks to find a way to become closer and more familiar with the local community in order to feel at home again. Through the neighborhood‚Äôs HOA, he is recommended to check out LOCALITY. Thanks to the site, Devin is now able to better see and attend local events, thereby feeling more included and involved in local affairs. 

Jimmy is 19 and works a full time, minimum wage job. He lives with 3 other roommates in a two-bedroom apartment. Since Jimmy and his roommates spend a lot of their time working, Jimmy wants an easy way of finding cool hobbies while staying connected with his roommates. He is having trouble finding other interests/hobbies outside of his immediate circle. He is then reminded about LOCALITY from a friend and opens it up to see a late-night event happening 2 blocks away this weekend. He sends the event details to his friends, and they plan to meet after work. Jimmy feels fulfilled with what he does after work and searching for things that interest him. 

Miguel is an out-of-state undergraduate student attending a school in the northeast outside a major city. The campus he lives on is a PWI, and as a person of color, he misses many of the cultural things that were integral to his upbringing. Some things include cultural food and community. Through a university club for out-of-state students, he finds LOCALITY, which shows him all the relevant cultural events around his area that he was previously unaware of. He now feels better represented and connected with the rich cultures and vibrant city nearby.

USER WORKFLOW 

New User 

Onboarding -> homepage (scrolling through carousels) -> event details (event clicked) -> back to homepage -> search -> add filters -> search results -> event details -> bookmarks 

Returning User 

Homepage -> sign in/join -> homepage -> event creation -> event details -> homepage -> account -> your events 

Casual User 

Onboarding -> homepage -> random event suggester -> event details 

COMPLETE ANALYSIS 

Meetup.com - Platform that allows users to attend events or join/start groups based on interests. Limitations are the emphasis on interests and hobbies which limits users' exposure to new groups and connections. 

Facebook - Facebook groups feature that allows people to come together and organize/plan events. Limitations include only being able to see groups you‚Äôve been added too, and you will only be exposed to such announcements on stories if you have a user added. 

Instagram - Instagram stories or posts where people can promote an upcoming event Limitations include that only people that you know or have added will only be notified about the event 

Snapchat ‚Äì Stories can be used to communicate ideas and events. Limitations include that you will only be exposed to such announcements on stories if you have the user added. 

Strengths: 

Educational ‚Äì directly educating users on other communities/cultures as they encounter new/unfamiliar events. 

Improved discovery ‚Äì with all community events being found in a centralized place. 

Emphasis on local events that promote community growth and inclusion. 

Weaknesses: 

User base: Will not have as many users/events at the beginning.  

Incentivize: Need to motivate people to use our product  

Trust: Putting a lot of trust in people that events are safe 

Convince: Convince if you go to this event, it will be worth it  

Opportunities: 

If we partner with local Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) (YMCA, local affinity groups, Boys and Girls Clubs, churches, HOAs) to make our product their main way of event advertising. CBO‚Äôs struggle to advertise events and gain participation with their lack of following on other social media platforms. Our product would thereby help these CBOs by providing those services, while also aiding in their awareness within the community. 

College students who often find themselves in new surroundings look for familiarity and sense of community. LOCALITY can facilitate their search for new events and people in their community. 

People who just moved into an area/tourist trying to find things to do/ a way to participate in their cultural traditions/holidays/ceremonies. LOCALITY can serve as their primary source of information regarding events going on around the area.  

Being able to easily share events across platforms to increase visibility of us and events, unlike competitors where you can only view an event on their platform. 

Threats: 

Onboarding issue ‚Äì not everyone in the community may want to join and the success of the platform revolves around a widespread user base. 

Security ‚Äì app can theoretically be used to spread misinformation on dangerous/illegitimate events. 

 

FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES - WHAT WOULD YOU BUILD NEXT? WHAT'S THE BIG DREAM FOR THE PRODUCT? 

Partnering with non-profits/community-based organizations (CBOs) 

EX. YMCA, local affinity groups, Boys and Girls Clubs, churches, HOAs

Addressing threats
